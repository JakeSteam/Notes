As [Walt Whitman said](https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51):

> I contain multitudes.

and as [Dave said](https://genius.com/Dave-picture-me-lyrics):

> Money ain't a measure of success.

We are all on multiple overlapping and contradicting "paths". Focusing on one might mean helping another, or it may mean sabotaging it. By defining how I identify myself, and the achievements along these paths, perhaps the awareness will help avoid self-sabotage. Or perhaps not.
