### Books

I'm always very grateful for new books / book suggestions in any genre, fiction or non-fiction, used or new! Here’s [my currently owned books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29398258-jake-lee?shelf=own) list, and [every book I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29398258-jake-lee?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read), both lists can be searched.
